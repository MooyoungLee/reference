0,positive_polarity,deceptive_from_MTurk,5,d_intercontinental_13.txt,"the intercontinental chicago is conveniently located near midway airport so the commute was short and easy. the room had a great view of a lake. room service was available 24 hours a day and the room came with a coffeemaker where you got complimentary coffee and tea which was great i did not have to go out for my morning cup of coffee. there was a business center that had internet, fax machines, and copy machines that was available for use 24 hours a day. one of my favorite things was the fitness center which had masseurs, it was exactly what i needed, very relaxing. the food at the eno was some of the best i ever ate especially the chocolate, i never wanted to leave. this was a great hotel experience and i would stay there again.

0,positive_polarity,deceptive_from_MTurk,5,d_palmer_20.txt,"very beautiful hotel. the historic features of this hotel make it absolutely amazing. this hotel offers many great guest accommodations of which i enjoyed the spacious, tidy rooms. the staff here are very friendly, helpful, and professional. the concierge went out of her way to make sure we knew about the area and not just what was in the hotel. i especially enjoyed the service at the lockwood restaurant here. our server was excellent and the food was delicious! i must say this hotel exceeded my expectations. all in all, my stay was awesome!

0,positive_polarity,deceptive_from_MTurk,5,d_intercontinental_10.txt,"at the intercontinental chicago, you pay for more than a room. you pay for an experience. let me elaborate. i was a bit reluctant to pay a premium for location and amenities. like any novice traveller to chicago, i saw the mass glut of cheap accommodations out in the suburbs, and those were originally what i set my sights on. price is a powerful signal, and the sheer discount of those options drew me in. but after doing a bit of research, i realised that distance does have its costs. the price of transit in the chicagoland area isn't free. and it's far from what i'm used to. car use is price prohibitive. (i knew that originally, which is why i wasn't going to drive.) but the sting of using the automobile (parking, congestion, toll roads, etc.) gets shoved off onto taxi fares and auto rental. so, i ultimately had to end up looking for a place well connected with mass transit. but mass transit has its costs too, which meant that staying at a focal point downtown had its advantages. that's what originally drew me to intercontinental. but intercontinental is much more than the right room at the right place. the decor of the rooms and the amenities available to the guest are unsurpassable. i was travelling on international business, so the ease with which i could transact in foreign currency was a draw. (they had a currency exchange right there on the premises.) and the fact that massages, dry cleaning, and event planning were available in-house was a huge plus. my work gets me tied up in knots. it also leaves little time for doing chores. so the ability to grab a massage while my suits were being finished was a relief for me. but, on top of all that, the event planning was what put intercontinental over the top. being able to coordinate a comprehensive tour of chicago while completing my business and managing my personal life was a weight off my shoulders--and something i won't forget. in the end, if you're a newcomer to chicago staying in a time-crunch, the intercontinental is for you. the pricetag of rooming downtown can seem prohibitive, but when you factor in the convenience and savings in marginal costs, it's nothing in the end. and the intercontinental is not only price-competitive with the other downtown options, it also makes staying downtown the convenience and thrill it should be.

0,positive_polarity,deceptive_from_MTurk,5,d_amalfi_3.txt,"i recently stayed at the amalfi chicago with my wife on a business trip. we decided to combine business with pleasure and made a long weekend out of our stay after business was concluded. we enjoyed the luxurious in-room spa service and stayed in the superb one bedroom suite with incomparable views of the surrounding city. the individualized attention from check-in to reservations was exceptional and better than what we usually receive from concierge service. the amalfi actually delivered what they promised and more. our weekend was more relaxing and enjoyable due to the excellent training of the staff and the amenities offered on site. the hotel's design is modern and sophisticated with the decor being a delight to the senses. lots of color and clean lines made a great impression and felt both modern and comfortable. breakfast is served on each floor or in room and my wife especially appreciated the availability of the fresh fruit and yogurt. being of european descent, i enjoyed the croissants, whole grain muffins, real butter and marmalade. we also brought along our standard poodle, sterling, and the amalfi is one of the few luxury hotels that allow for pet accommodations and understand that your pet is part of the family. we purchased the pet pamper package and this allowed sterling to have his days while we had ours and we reunited in the evenings. sterling slept in our room as usual at the foot of our bed and this contributed to our feeling ""at home"" while away. for pet lovers this is a big plus. finally, transportation to and from our corporate jet was arranged with ease by the hotel so we did not bring an assistant with us on this trip to handle these arrangements as is normal. this allowed us a bit more privacy and it is scarce for us to be able to do this, another appreciated bonus of our stay. thank you amalfi for a superb experience.

1,negative_polarity,truthful_from_Web,5,t_palmer_17.txt,"the hotel is excellently situated for visiting the art institute or millennium park. it is an ""old classic"" of a hotel, and the main lobby is a must see, but i would not stay there again. the problem with any hotel dating from long ago (the current one was built in 1923-25) is that, even with extensive remodeling (which was done in 2007-2009) it is hard to create spaces that are comparable to what is expected today (in many cases the walls are load bearing so cannot be changed too much). we had a reasonably sized room (king bed and space for a desk and lounge chair) but the bathroom was very small with little space to spread out toiletries. also, there was no coffee machine in the room - something i have come to expect in virtually all hotels these days. my major complaint about this stay was the executive lounge. it is usually worth while to pay the extra for access - in most hotels it is not much more than the cost of two breakfasts and there are usually some hors d'oeuvres in the evening along with a modest wine at a modest price. (since we are currently at the diamond level in the hilton honors program, we get access for free at the hiltons but i usually upgrade at other chains such as the hyatt.) at the palmer executive lounge i ordered a couple of glasses of wine (there was a bartender on duty) and was slightly surprised by the cost - $9/glass which came to $21.44 for two with tax and tip - and was even more surprised by the wine. it was about the worst wine i had tasted in many years. i didn't think it was even as good as trader joe's cheapest $2.99 wine that i tried a couple of weeks ago. unfortunately i didn't get a look at the bottle to see what it was (although i did notice that she had to fish it out of the back of a cupboard). i noticed that a couple of groups in the executive lounge had brought their own wine in - and i can understand iot at the prices they were charging. it then occurred to me that the wine had been sitting around open for some time. i checked the room service menu and saw that they offered three red wines by the glass - the same three varietals as at the bar. the cabernet was a william hill at $10.50/glass from room service. i presume that what i had had at some time been a william hill that had been left to turn to vinegar. it was slightly more expensive from room service, but i hope that it was in a lot better condition.

(the lobby, by the way, used to be beautiful and open with lots of places to sit. also no longer...). the food is very bad. very. bad. there are so many restaurants in this city. do yourself a favor and go somewhere else to eat. its relatively low price compared to comparable hotels: based on my review of everything else. go to the drake, or the peninsula. completely worth the extra money... that, or downgrade to the hilton and get what you expect and pay for... the intercontinental has fallen so low that you pay a higher price than the hilton, but you get a worse experience! its exclusive benefits of the ambassador membership: i canceled our membership after this disaster. part of the membership includes early check-in (granted, when available)... but our room wasn't ready until 6pm. this is obviously after normal check-in. the staff was overwhelmed, and not effective or helpful. i tried to speak with the manager about our room, waited in long line to speak with someone, only to be told that my husband needed to be with me because the membership was in his name. in a nutshell. go somewhere else. ps: go to argo tea next door instead of the starbucks in the hotel. way better food and coffee.

1,negative_polarity,truthful_from_Web,5,t_allegro_19.txt,"i'm a frequent business traveler and often in chicago on trips. at times, it's very difficult to even find a hotel in downtown chicago, and this was one of those times. i recently had to pay almost $400 for one night at the allegro. it was absolutely not worth it. the hotel was filled to capacity with conventioneers, so check-in and check-out were very slow. there were very few elevators, which were worked beyond capacity with all the guests. the morning i checked out, our elevator stopped at every single floor from the 16th floor down to the lobby, but the elevator was almost completely full when i got on at the 18th floor, so i can only imagine how long it must have taken other guests to get downstairs. the room was extremely small and cramped, even though it had obviously been renovated recently. the tv, bed, and decor were all new and were the high points of the hotel. still, the rate was way overpriced for such a small room. the best thing about the allegro was the room service, which was prompt. the food was good, and the prices were very reasonable for room service. from now on, if my regular hotels are booked, i'll just take a cab farther out from the city because it just isn't worth it.

1,negative_polarity,truthful_from_Web,5,t_palmer_19.txt,"will not stay here again. we were here pre-construction so didn't have the noise problems that others are now experiencing. but room and service quality were so poor that we will not return. our suite was large enough, but it was dirty, dated and worn. the bed linens were stained and the bathroom did not appear to have been cleaned properly. public hall areas had room service trays sitting for two days, disgusting. we (politely) requested housekeeping to touch up our room and pick up trays and they never showed. we had paid for the king tut package, which was supposed to include tickets to the exhibit. they had no record of this and didn't honor it. of course, the exhibit was sold out, so our main reason for visiting chicago was ruined as we weren't able to see this part of the field museum. my (also polite) letter to hilton and the manager was never acknowledged. very very disappointed in this property and am now avoiding hilton in general when possible.

1,negative_polarity,truthful_from_Web,5,t_palmer_2.txt,"booked through hotwire and consequently was placed in a room where we barely had room to walk around our luggage. the 'view' was of the 'inner courtyard' of nothing but walls of windows of the other rooms. you were unable to determine what the weather was outside except that it was either day or night. they no longer have in-room coffee appliances. you either have to go down to their ostentatious dining room, or go around the corner to starbucks or mcdonald's. internet access is not free ($12.95/24 hours), the ""gift shop"" is a joke (tucked away in the corner of the coat check room, concierge services have limited hours, and the business center is open only during 'business hours' which made it difficult to get work done after 'business hours."" i would not stay there ever again, nor do i recommend it to anyone. i have had better stays at any holiday inn express!

1,negative_polarity,truthful_from_Web,5,t_intercontinental_4.txt,"spent three nights in chicago at this property. first of all, i have to say that it would be hard to imagine a better location as it is perfectly situated on the magnificent mile close to terrific restaurants, the art institute and orchestra hall. the hotel has two sides - the historic tower and a new wing. the rooms are larger on the historic side but generally are looking a little tired. this property needs to be renovated. some observations: the junior suite i had was laid out strangely. a small bedroom and smaller sitting room separated by a corridor off of which was the very large bathroom. the mirror over the sink was not over the sink but skewed to the right - made shaving a challenge and messy. while descending in the elevator one morning, it started shaking so violently that i could barely stand up. it stopped on the 11th floor and i was greeted by an extremely worried looking hotel employee who had a technician shut it down. (this experience was far more powerful than coffee in helping me wake up - an adrenaline rush certainly cures sleepiness!) reports from my group were of sinks stopped up, exposed bolts in rooms, and generally things not working. now the good news - the staff is terrific. they make you feel welcome, are personable, have their own personalities, great service in the bar and really went the extra distance to help. i wish they had a better property to work in.

1,negative_polarity,truthful_from_Web,5,t_intercontinental_5.txt,"it is always interesting going to a high quality hotel. i cannot help but think about the service and the value. maybe i have too high expectations. certaintly the location is great and the swimming pool is really nice and the room was generally well appointed oh and the bed was great. but, the room was not well cleaned, a little smelly truthfully and they stole a watch that i left in the room. the hotel where immediately worried about there financial situation and not the service. i noticed here others on this site have lost stuff from this hotel. i know that this is always a possibility but really did not expect it at a hotel like this. overall, chicago exceeded my expectations but the intercontinental did not. stay else where.

1,negative_polarity,truthful_from_Web,5,t_palmer_3.txt,"here are my experiences: - had three rooms reserved, when checked in we were charged 2 different rates for the rooms - screwed up initial room assignments, gave us a room that was not even cleaned yet when we checked in - could not get us new keys to a different room without great difficulty (we had to go to the front desk because bell staff went to the wrong room to give us new keys) - in room guide says pool in on the 8th floor and signs say it is on the 7th - could not get to the pool from the 14th floor without going all the way down to the lobby and then had to go to the 7th floor and take the stairs to the 8th - when we checked in we had the front desk staff go over which credit cards were assigned to which room. - when we received our bills, the credit card assignments were still wrong. i stay at ""economy"" hotels a lot and i have not even come close to having this many problems with a hotel until this one. this hotel should do chicago a service and just close its doors. due to this experience, i will never stay downtown again to deal with overpriced hotels with poor service and surrounding business that are just as bad.

1,negative_polarity,truthful_from_Web,5,t_allegro_20.txt,"i am usually a big fan of kimpton hotels, but this place is awful !!! i would rate it poor from the moment we arrived to the moment we left. it is an old, dark and damp hotel that they slapped a coat of paint on to make it look more ""botique"" . the carpets are dirty, and tattered; patrons are walking around the lobby in their barefeet. yuck!!! the bathrooms are tiny, and the floors look like they have a layer of flith on them. when we called down to the desk to ask for them to be cleaned, we were brushed off and told they were made to look that way. we woke up on the first morning to find multiple wads of gum on the lobby table. we told the front desk, called housekeeping, and then called the front desk again..finally after several hours someone came and cleaned the gum. the elevators are slow, and often only one is working at any given time. i did not find the staff to be friendly at all, except for one waiter @ breakfast. what a disappointment :(

1,negative_polarity,truthful_from_Web,5,t_palmer_20.txt,"after leaving some important documents in the room, i called and asked for the lost and found department... seven times over the course of a week. eventually i had enough and asked for a manager and was put on hold then disconnected. finally , a deceivingly friendly operator promised me she would have someone call me back in a few minutes, it never happened. so avoid this place because after they rip you off once they'll keep doing it later. they cannot be trusted at their word

1,negative_polarity,truthful_from_Web,5,t_palmer_1.txt,"ok, i just feel if you're paying well over $200 for a room you should get something to show for it. the location was on michigan ave but if i pay just a little more i could have had way better (peninsula, park hyatt, shoot the omni was 10x better). we ordered a deluxe executive suite, and it was so below sub par. the room was very small (so small the ice bucket was in the closet), the bathroom was just as small, just well lit (a plus). wallpaper was peeling, outlets barely covered, no view. the only thing appealing was the bed, and that may have been because i was so tired. and we were really excited because this is the palmer house. the palmer house does have nice restaurants: the lockwood (quiet, distinguished) and the potter's lounge (grown/sexy)

1,negative_polarity,truthful_from_Web,5,t_intercontinental_7.txt,"i am writing in regards to our stay april 22-24. we were celebrating our honeymoon and were disappointed with our stay. there was construction going on in the hotel and we were not notified of it prior to our stay. my husband had ordered champagne and strawberries for the room to be in there prior to our arrival...it wasn't. when he called to place the order again, it never showed up. we were so disappointed and surprised by the lack of service that we decided to forgo ordering them for a 3rd time. our room was very small, drab and lacked the romantic setting we were looking for. we had called to request a room with a large tub, similar to the ones in the photos, prior to our arrival, noting that we didn't mind an upgrade cost. instead, the tub was incredibly small. we have stayed at the intercontinental in other cities before and had such high expectations for the chicago location, especially considering we were celebrating such a happy, once-in-a-lifetime occasion. the service and amenities just didn't match up.

1,negative_polarity,truthful_from_Web,5,t_intercontinental_6.txt,"used this hotel the first time i was in chicago. for the prices and for being classified an intercontinental...i wouldn't consider it that good. the rooms were solid. the view was ok (but so is it virtually everywhere else on michigan ave.) the service was ok. the prices were ridiculous for everything from wifi to well everything else. we came here for a jewish/hindi wedding. appetizer was fine. main entree was a small portion of meat with forgettable everything else. dessert was inedible. i have been to some other expensive hotels with similar ratings but they had more or just better rooms to an extent that it would be worth it. i personally preferred the conrad. better prices and better service.
